#### Notes

- `words.txt` contains a sample of Donald Knuth's list of five letter English words, available [here](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt).

- The text output includes some formatting (dimmed text, strikethrough) that may not display correctly on all terminals (particularly WSL).
